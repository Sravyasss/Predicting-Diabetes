# Predicting Diabetes Progression: A Data-Driven Approach to Type Prediction and Age-Based Prevalence

> The following project seeks to address whether the type of diabetes a patient possesses can be accurately predicted given of demographic and health data. 

---

## Project Overview

The project utilizes exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques to discern the relationship between health factors and the stage of diabetes for a patient. The data examined in the project comprises 100,000 patient records that were compiled from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Each patient record contains upwards of 35 features exploring demographic, lifestyle, and health data. Additional investigations were conducted to determine how the risk of developing diabetes varies across different age groups. 

- **Objective:** To determine which clinical health indicators or demographic factors are the greatest predictors of the type of diabetes a patient has.  
- **Domain:** Healthcare
- **Key Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis, One-Hot Encoding, Multi-Class Classification (including Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN))
